# Dockerized Scispacy


This repository contains a Dockerfile for running [Scispacy](https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/) in a containerized environment. Scispacy is a Python package for biomedical and clinical natural language processing (NLP) that provides pre-trained models for various tasks.

To run you can use the prepackaged Docker image available on GHCR:

```bash
docker run -p "8000:8000" ghcr.io/nanth-uw/dockerized-scispacy:latest
```

and then open [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) in your browser to view the Swagger UI for the API.

## Usage

See the [client example](examples/client.py) for how to use the API. The client is a simple Python script that sends a request to the Dockerized API after reading in generated notes using pandas. The API will return the processed notes with the relevant information extracted.

> NOTE: if you use this example specifically you will need to generate the fake notes using the [generator script](scripts/generate_fake_csv.py) first. This will create CSV file with 100 fake notes in the `data` directory. You can change the number of notes generated by changing the `num_notes` parameter in the script. The generated CSV file will be saved in the `data` directory with the name `fake_biomedical_notes.csv`. You can then use this file as input to the client example.

All of this is expected to be run using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) :)
